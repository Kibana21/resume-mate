- Low substitutability (0-3) → increase criticality
- High substitutability (7-10) → downgrade importance

**4. Market Scarcity** (0-10):
- How rare is this skill in the market?
- High scarcity + Critical → flag as "hard to fill"
- High scarcity + Preferred → consider removing to broaden pool

**5. Hiring Manager Intent**:
- Did hiring manager mark as required/preferred/nice-to-have?
- Override automatic classification if HM explicitly sets priority

**Combined Scoring**:
```
Criticality Score = (Role Necessity × 0.4) +
                    ((10 - Learnability) × 0.3) +
                    ((10 - Substitutability) × 0.2) +
                    (Hiring Manager Override × 0.1)

Score 8-10 → Critical
Score 5-7 → Important
Score 1-4 → Preferred
```
