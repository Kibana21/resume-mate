# Resume Mate - Improvement Roadmap

## üéØ High Priority Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Achievement Extraction** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current Issue:** Achievements are captured but not deeply analyzed for metrics

**Improvements:**
- Extract quantifiable metrics (percentages, dollar amounts, time saved)
- Parse impact metrics: "reduced by 200%", "$250,000 project", "26% of policies"
- Create achievement categories: Cost Savings, Performance Improvements, Revenue Impact
- Add achievement scoring based on quantifiability and impact

**Example:**
```python
class Achievement(BaseModel):
    description: str
    metric_value: Optional[float] = None  # e.g., 26, 200, 250000
    metric_unit: Optional[str] = None  # e.g., "percent", "USD", "months"
    impact_category: Optional[str] = None  # "cost_saving", "performance", "revenue"
    quantifiable: bool = False
```

### 2. **Skills Proficiency & Endorsement** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current Issue:** Skills are flat list without context

**Improvements:**
- Extract skill proficiency levels (Expert, Advanced, Intermediate, Beginner)
- Calculate years of experience per skill from work history
- Identify primary vs secondary skills
- Detect skill clusters (e.g., full-stack: React + Node + PostgreSQL)

**Example:**
```python
class Skill(BaseModel):
    name: str
    proficiency_level: Optional[str] = None  # "Expert", "Advanced", etc.
    years_of_experience: Optional[float] = None
    last_used: Optional[date] = None
    mentioned_count: int = 1  # How many times mentioned in CV
    context: List[str] = []  # Where it was used (which companies/projects)
```

---

### 3. **CV-to-Job Description Matching** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current Issue:** No matching capability

**Improvements:**
- Add JD parsing endpoint
- Calculate match score (0-100)
- Show skill gaps and overlaps
- Highlight missing required skills
- Suggest relevant experience matches

**Example:**
```python
class CVJDMatchResult(BaseModel):
    overall_match_score: float  # 0-100
    skill_match_score: float
    experience_match_score: float
    education_match_score: float
    matching_skills: List[str]
    missing_required_skills: List[str]
    missing_preferred_skills: List[str]
    relevant_experience: List[WorkExperience]
    recommendations: List[str]
```

---

### 4. **Better Error Handling & Validation** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current Issue:** Silent failures in extraction

**Improvements:**
- Add confidence scores for each extracted field
- Flag low-confidence extractions
- Add validation warnings (e.g., "Phone number format unusual")
- Implement retry logic for failed extractions
- Add extraction quality indicators

**Example:**
```python
class FieldExtraction(BaseModel):
    value: Any
    confidence: float  # 0-1
    evidence: Optional[str] = None  # Text snippet supporting extraction
    extraction_method: str  # "dspy_cot", "regex", "rule_based"
    warnings: List[str] = []
```

---

### 5. **Timeline & Gap Analysis** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Current Issue:** Employment gaps detected but not analyzed deeply

**Improvements:**
- Create visual timeline representation
- Analyze gap reasons (education, career break, etc.)
- Detect overlapping positions (red flag or consulting)
- Calculate career velocity (promotions per year)

**Example:**
```python
class CareerTimeline(BaseModel):
    total_duration_months: int
    active_months: int
    gap_months: int
    gaps: List[EmploymentGap]
    overlaps: List[EmploymentOverlap]
    career_velocity: float  # promotions per year
```
